Okay, let's break down how to replicate the core effects and structure of that website using Next.js, focusing on the specific changes you requested (scroll-triggered intro, your name/title, your projects).

This is a complex design with sophisticated animations. Achieving an exact replica requires significant effort, especially with the smooth, physics-based feel. We'll focus on the main mechanics.

Core Technologies:

Framework: Next.js (App Router recommended for modern features, but Pages Router is fine too)

Animation Library: Framer Motion is an excellent choice for React/Next.js. It integrates well and simplifies complex animations, including scroll-triggered ones. GSAP (GreenSock) + ScrollTrigger is another powerful option, potentially offering more fine-grained control for very complex sequences, but Framer Motion is often more intuitive within the React ecosystem. We'll plan assuming Framer Motion.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (highly recommended for rapid UI development and consistency) or CSS Modules/Styled Components.

State Management: React's built-in useState, useRef, and potentially Context or a lightweight library like Zustand/Jotai if needed for global state (like navigation).

Technical Plan (Desktop Only Focus):

Phase 1: Setup & Basic Layout

Initialize Next.js Project:

npx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio --tailwind --eslint
cd my-portfolio


Install Framer Motion:

npm install framer-motion

Global Layout Component:

Create a components/Layout.js component.

Include the main header navigation (Works, Info, Contact buttons) - likely fixed or sticky.

Include the "Archive of Selected Works" title - also likely fixed/sticky.

This layout will wrap your page content.

Basic Page Structure (app/page.js or pages/index.js):

Import the Layout.

Define areas for the Intro sequence and the main Portfolio section.

Phase 2: Scroll-Triggered Intro Animation

Challenge: Replicating the automatic Name -> Title -> Zoom sequence but making it driven by the initial scroll gestures.

Approach: Use Framer Motion's scroll-linked animations (useScroll, useTransform).

Create an "Intro Container":

This container needs to be scrollable before the main portfolio content is revealed. It could be a div with a height greater than the viewport (e.g., 200vh or 300vh) but positioned cleverly so it doesn't initially push content down visually.

Alternatively, listen to the window scroll event directly when the user is at the very top.

Track Scroll Progress:

Use useScroll hook from Framer Motion, targeting the intro container or the window.

const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll({ target: introContainerRef }); (if using a container) or track window.scrollY.

Animate Text Based on Scroll:

Name ("Chirantan Bhardwaj"):

Use motion.h1 or similar.

Use useTransform to map scrollYProgress (or scrollY) to opacity and maybe scale.

Example: opacity: useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5], [0, 1, 1, 0]) - Fades in between 0% and 20% scroll, holds, fades out between 40% and 50%.

Title ("Entrepreneur"):

Similar motion.h2.

Animate its opacity and scale based on a later part of the scroll progress.

Example: opacity: useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0.4, 0.5, 0.8], [0, 1, 1]) - Fades in between 40% and 50%, holds.

Example: scale: useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0.4, 0.5], [0.8, 1]) - Scales up as it fades in.

Trigger the Zoom Transition:

The zoom effect (black shape wiping/zooming) should start animating towards the end of the intro scroll sequence (e.g., when scrollYProgress is between 0.8 and 1.0).

Create a motion.div for the black shape (overlay). Position it fixed to cover the screen.

Use useTransform to control its scale, clipPath, or height/width based on the scroll progress.

Example (using scale): scale: useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0.7, 1.0], [0, 150]) - Starts scaling up from the center from 70% scroll, massively overscaling by 100% to ensure coverage. Adjust origin (transformOrigin).

Example (using clip-path): Animate clip-path: circle(...) or inset(...).

Once this animation completes (at scrollYProgress 1.0), the intro sequence is done, and the main portfolio should be visible underneath. You might need to hide the intro text elements at this point.

Phase 3: Portfolio Scrolling Effect

Challenge: Replicating the effect where scrolling reveals the next project with a smaller image zooming out to become the background/main visual.

Approach: Full-screen sections with scroll-snapping and layered animations.

Portfolio Container:

A main container that holds all project sections.

Style it to enable vertical scrolling. Maybe use CSS Scroll Snap for smoother transitions between projects:

/* In your CSS/Tailwind */
.portfolio-container {
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  height: 100vh; /* Or appropriate height */
}
.project-section {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  height: 100vh;
  position: relative; /* Needed for positioning inner elements */
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevent content spill */
}

Project Section Component (components/ProjectSection.js):

Each section represents one project (your screenshots). It should take up the full viewport height (h-screen).

Background Layer: The main visual for the current project (e.g., your screenshot displayed large, perhaps within a device mockup like in the video). This could be a simple img or a div with background-image.

Foreground Layer (Transition Image): This is the preview of the next project, initially small and centered.

Use motion.div or motion.img for this preview.

Position it absolutely/fixed in the center initially.

Use useScroll hook again, but this time target the portfolio container or track the scroll progress relative to each section entering the viewport. whileInView or IntersectionObserver can help trigger animations as a section comes into view.

Use useTransform to map the scroll progress as the current section scrolls up/out to the scale and opacity of this foreground image.

It should scale up from small (e.g., scale: 0.2) to large (e.g., scale: 1 or slightly larger to cover the screen) as you scroll towards the next section.

Simultaneously, the background of the current section might fade out or scale down slightly.

Data Structure: Define an array of your projects, each with an image URL and other relevant info. Map over this array to render the ProjectSection components.

Pagination: Add the "1 - 6" indicator. You can use IntersectionObserver API to detect which project section is currently most visible and update a state variable to display the correct number.

Phase 4: Navigation and Other Pages/Sections

Works/Info/Contact Toggle:

Use React state (useState) to keep track of the currently active view ('works', 'info', 'contact').

The header buttons update this state.

Conditionally render the Portfolio Container, the Info Section, or the Contact Section based on this state. Use Framer Motion's AnimatePresence for smooth transitions between these views if they replace each other in the same spot.

Alternatively, if they are distinct pages, use Next.js Link component and standard routing (/, /info, /contact). The video looks more like a single-page application switching content sections.

Info Section: Create a component with your bio, services, etc. Style it according to the reference (likely appears when 'info' is clicked).

Contact Section: Create a component with contact details/form (appears when 'contact' is clicked).

Project Detail Pages (Optional but Good Practice):

If you want users to click a project and see more details:

Use Next.js dynamic routing (e.g., app/projects/[slug]/page.js).

Create a template for displaying project details.

Link each ProjectSection in the main scroll view to its corresponding detail page.

Phase 5: Styling and Refinements

Tailwind CSS: Apply styles extensively to match the dark theme, typography, button styles, and layout of the reference video. Pay attention to padding, margins, and font choices.

Device Mockups: Use CSS or pre-made components/images to wrap your project screenshots in laptop, phone, or tablet frames as seen in the video.

Cursor Follower: Implement the small dot cursor using JavaScript to track mouse coordinates and CSS to position a small div.

Performance: Optimize images (use Next.js <Image> component). Ensure animations are smooth (Framer Motion typically uses hardware acceleration). Test thoroughly.

Key Implementation Details (Framer Motion):

motion.div: Wrap elements you want to animate.

animate prop: Define target animation states.

initial prop: Define starting animation states.

transition prop: Control duration, easing, delay, type (spring, tween).

whileHover, whileTap: For interactive animations.

useScroll: Get scroll progress.

useTransform: Map scroll progress (or other motion values) to CSS properties (opacity, scale, x, y, clipPath, etc.).

AnimatePresence: For animating components when they mount/unmount (useful for view switching).

Layout Animations: Framer Motion automatically handles animations when layout changes, which can be very helpful.

Summary of Changes:

Replace "Williams Alamu" with "Chirantan Bhardwaj".

Replace "a creative visual designer" with "Entrepreneur".

Make the initial Name -> Title -> Zoom sequence trigger on scroll instead of automatically.

Replace the 6 portfolio images with your project screenshots.

Update the Info/Bio section with your details.

Update Contact details.

This is a challenging but rewarding project. Start simple, focus on one animation at a time (especially the scroll-triggered intro and the portfolio transition), and build iteratively. Good luck!
